A Server application built using SwiftNIO. `niots` works as an echo server, but modifies the text before sending it back to the client.

The server was created using [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio).

You can read the article explaining the command-line tool, here:

You can also get the "macOS network programming in Swift" guide. It includes more topics on building network applications on macOS, including:

+ BSD Sockets in Swift
+ Apple's Network.framework
+ SwiftNIO
